# Solutions to CS231n assignments
**Version: Spring 2019**

This repository gathers my personal solutions to the CS231n assignments for the Spring 2019 offering. [CS231n](http://cs231n.github.io/) is a course on "Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition" given at Stanford University.

My solutions are compatible with **Python 3.7*. I used **PyTorch 1.0** as a Deep Learning framework.

## Original assignments
You can download the original assignments, without the solutions, here:
* Assignment 1: http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2019/assignment1
* Assignment 2: http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2019/assignment2
* Assignment 3: http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2019/assignment3

## Course content
If you want to learn the theory behind these assignments, you can find the course notes on the [CS231n website] (http://cs231n.github.io/).

You can also watch the lecture videos from the Spring 2017 offering of this course:

Finally GitHub user "mbadry1" put together a very clever summary of the lectures in this [repository](https://github.com/mbadry1/CS231n-2017-Summary). Don't forget to thank him if you find this summary useful!

## Setup
* For all the assignments, first follow the the CS231n [setup instructions](http://cs231n.github.io/setup-instructions/) to install the necessary virtual environment.
* If you want to work on Google Cloud, you can follow their tutorial on this [repository](https://github.com/cs231n/gcloud/).
* To download the CIFAR-10 datasets needed for the assignments, run the bash file "get_datasets.sh" in the folder "cs231n/datasets".
* For "assignment2", you also need to run "python setup.py build_ext --inplace" in the folder "cs231n".

## Disclaimer
The goal of this repository is to help students interested in learning more about Computer Vision. Doing these assignments is a valuable way to learn the concepts and understand the implementations of Deep Learning methods. This repository provides a way to check the solutions.

By any mean should Stanford students currently enrolled in CS231n refer to these solutions. This constitutes a [Honor Code](https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/honor-code) violation.

Finally, these are my personal solutions and should not be considered as the ground truth. If you spot some mistakes or imprecisions, feel free to open an issue.

## Acknowledgment
I would like to thank the Professors, Justin Johnson, Fei-Fei Li, Serena Yeung and Andrej Karpathy for putting together this amazing course! A special thanks for making all the resources available to the public.
I would also like to thank the teaching staff, all the Teaching Assistants, for making this course run smoothly and for helping out students.
